<h2>
About
</h2>
<p>
I'm Efe Udolu-Joshua, a highly motivated computer science student with a strong programming skill set, enthusiastic about gaining practical experience through a software engineering internship. I'm able to engineer efficient solutions to problems, and I'm always open to seeking guidance and learning from my peers. I have proficient skills in Python (including DSA) and I'm familiar with HTML. My deep passion for soccer and sports, in general, has led me to start exploring the field of data analytics. <u>An example of this exploration can be seen in a project that I'm currently engaged in, analyzing data from the 2013/14 season of the UEFA Champions League to create a starting XI of the most effective players of that season.</u>
