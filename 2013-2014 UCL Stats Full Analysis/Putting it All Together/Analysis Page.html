Attacking Players in my Best XI
</center>
</h2>

<p>
I've decided that my best XI will lineup in a 4-2-3-1 formation. This formation takes one striker, two wingers, an attacking midfielder, two defensive midfielders, two centerbacks, and two fullbacks. My front 4 consists of Ronaldo, Bale, Di Maria, and Ibrahimovic. I'll breakdown why each player earned a spot in my best XI.
</p>
<p>
Cristiano Ronaldo's performance as a left winger during the 2013/2014 UEFA Champions League season was absolutely devastating. With 17 goals and 5 assists, totaling 22 combined goals and assists, a UCL record, he showcased his versatility and impact on the team. His remarkable goals per 90 minutes ratio of 1.54 underscored his goal-scoring prowess. He's seen at the top of many of these graphs, which just typifies how he's been at the top of this sport for so so long. Ronaldo's presence on the left wing made him a constant threat. His speed, technical skill, and goal-scoring ability consistently disrupted opposing defenses. His ability to take on defenders one-on-one and find the back of the net marked him as a true game-changer. Furthermore, Ronaldo's record-breaking goal-scoring feats affirmed his status as one of the greatest footballers in history. His commitment to excellence and unmatched dedication set him apart, providing a significant advantage for his team. There's absolutely no doubt that Ronaldo starts on the left wing for this best XI.
</p>
<p>
Lionel Messi's greatness is widely acknowledged, and his reputation as one of the footballing legends is well-deserved. In the 2013/2014 UEFA Champions League season, while he may not have been at his absolute peak due to injury concerns, his performance still showcased his exceptional skills. With 8 goals and a goals-per-90-minute ratio of 1.14, Messi's scoring ability remained impressive, even in the face of physical challenges. Moreover, delivering an average of 1 through ball per game demonstrated his playmaking prowess and vision on the field. In essence, it's a testament to Messi's remarkable talent that, even when dealing with injuries and not performing at his absolute best, he still managed to make a significant impact. It speaks volumes about his resilience, versatility, and unwavering quality, and his performances this season put him straight into this best XI. 
</p>
<p>
Ángel Di María's 2013/2014 UEFA Champions League season was defined by his outstanding creativity, clutch performances, and significant contributions. With 6 assists, tying for the season's most, he served as the creative engine of his side, consistently setting up goal-scoring opportunities. What truly set him apart was his ability to shine in critical moments, showcasing his pivotal role in the team's success. Moreover, being tied for 3rd in goal contributions that season highlighted his all-around impact. Di María's versatility and ability to both create and score goals make him a clear choice for this best XI. He stood a level above all other attacking midfielders in this UCL season.
</p>
<p>
In a season that may not have been characterized by an extraordinary striker performance, Zlatan Ibrahimović still managed to stand out with his solid contribution. Finishing as the second-highest goal-scorer, he proved to be one of the few potent threats in his team's attack. With the third-highest goals per 90 minutes and the second-highest in goal contributions, Zlatan demonstrated his ability to consistently make an impact. Despite the relative challenges, his goal-scoring prowess and all-around offensive contributions were invaluable, making him an essential element in his team's success. Being the best centre forward of the lot this season, Zlatan goes up top in my team.

In the next section, I will be choosing the rest of my team, excluding the goalkeeper.
